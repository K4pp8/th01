## Comments
It took me about 6 hours to complete this challenge.
I find the time to be excessive but that is because I did so many small one hour/half hour sessions. This leads to having a big problem with context switching.

With more time I would have: 
organized the code better ( in multiple files with different structures ).
named variables and functions better ( use more or less specific names )
made a system for managing styles automatically( scss -> in-line )
with a different file structure also unit tests and code coverage would have been better
